== Starting the Administration Console

To administer GlassFish Server and manage users, resources, and Jakarta
EE applications, use the Administration Console tool. GlassFish Server
must be running before you invoke the Administration Console. To start
the Administration Console, open a browser at

=== To Start the Administration Console Using NetBeans IDE

1.  Click the *Services* tab.
2.  Expand *Servers*.
3.  Right-click the *GlassFish Server instance* and select 
*View Domain Admin Console*.

[NOTE]
NetBeans IDE uses your default web browser to open the Administration
Console.
